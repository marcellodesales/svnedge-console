# Tips for the System Administration Screens
#
tip.admin.1=Do you have multiple Subversion Edge servers in your organization? <a href="/csvn/setupTeamForge/index">Connect</a> them to TeamForge and they can all be controlled and managed from a single web-based user interface.
tip.admin.2=If your server needs to go through a proxy to reach the Internet be sure to <a href="/csvn/server/editProxy">configure your proxy server</a> so that Subversion Edge can check for and retrieve updates.
tip.admin.3=Configuring LDAP can be difficult. Be sure to read the <a target="_blank" href="https://ctf.open.collab.net/sf/wiki/do/viewPage/projects.svnedge/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions"> LDAP section of the FAQ</a> for tips and troubleshooting techniques.
tip.admin.4=Once your repositories are backed up to the CollabNet Cloud, they are additionally backed up according to the same procedures as all of our cloud hosted customers. So you never have to worry about losing your valuable source code assets. <a target="_blank" href="http://codesion.com/security/secure-backups.html">Read more</a>
tip.admin.5=Do you need an issue tracker, agile planning tool or wiki? <a href="/csvn/setupTeamForge/index">Connect</a> Subversion Edge to TeamForge. <a href="http://www.open.collab.net/products/ctf/"> More information ...</a>
tip.admin.6=Subversion Edge makes it easy to configure and manage a Subversion server. Want something even easier? Sign up for <a href="/csvn/setupCloudServices/index">CollabNet Cloud Services</a> and let someone else manage your development servers. Once you are in the cloud you can easily add additional tools like Scrumworks Pro or even git.
tip.admin.7=Configure your <a href="/csvn/server/editMail"> Mail Server information</a> so that Subversion Edge can email you when background jobs have completed or to inform you of any errors in those jobs.
tip.admin.8=Are you considering agile or running any agile projects already? Look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.open.collab.net/products/scrumworks/">Scrumworks Pro</a> for an easy to use agile management tool.
tip.admin.9=One of the best features Subversion Edge provides is automatic log rotation. Be sure to <a href="/csvn/log/configure">configure the number of log files to keep</a> so that your server disk does not fill up with log files.
tip.admin.10=Need help configuring or managing your Subversion environment? CollabNet provides support, training and services. <a href="/csvn/ocn/index">Learn more on the Extensions page</a>.
tip.admin.11=You should periodically backup your Subversion Edge data folder so that you have a backup of your database and other configuration files that are managed by Subversion Edge.
tip.admin.12=Are you supporting a large geographically distributed team across slow WAN links? <a href="/csvn/setupTeamForge/index">Connect</a> Subversion Edge to TeamForge and you can use their combined support for Subversion replicas and proxies. Drop a Subversion Edge proxy in the LAN of your remote team and they will get fast read access to their repositories, but still be governed by the access control model defined in TeamForge.
tip.admin.13=Have you signed up for your <a href="/csvn/setupCloudServices/index">free Cloud Services account</a> yet? You can backup up to 500 MB of repository data for free. Pricing plans are available if you need more space.
tip.admin.14=You only need to create user accounts for built-in users. If using LDAP your users are created and managed by your LDAP server, such as Windows Active Directory. Users can login to the console with their LDAP credentials and that will create a "user placeholder" account to which you can assign administrator roles if desired.
tip.admin.15=Want to delegate administrative functionality in a more fine-grained manner? <br /> <br /> <a href="/csvn/setupTeamForge/index">Connect</a> Subversion Edge to TeamForge -- which introduces the concept of projects. A user can be an administrator for one project and not even be able to see that other projects exist.
#
# Tip keys can include the controller or even the controller plus action, which
# are discoverable via the URL pattern: /csvn/controller/action
# If more specific tips exist for a given controller or action, their chances
# of being shown are increased. But the more generic tips will still occasionally
# be shown even when more specific tips are available.  Tips can also be used 
# under more than one key using <alias>anotherTipKey</alias> for the value.
# This offers some advantage over simply repeating the values when localizing
# this file to other languages.

tip.admin.server.editAuthentication.1=<alias>tip.admin.3</alias>
tip.admin.server.editAuthentication.2=<alias>tip.admin.14</alias>

# Tips for the User Administration Screens
#
tip.adminUser.1=You only need to create user accounts for built-in users. If using LDAP your users are created and managed by your LDAP server, such as Windows Active Directory. Users can login to the console with their LDAP credentials and that will create a "user placeholder" account to which you can assign administrator roles if desired.
tip.adminUser.2=Want to delegate administrative functionality in a more fine-grained manner? <br /> <br /> Connect Subversion Edge to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.open.collab.net/products/ctf/">TeamForge</a> -- which introduces the concept of projects. A user can be an administrator for one project and not even be able to see that other projects exist.
tip.adminUser.3=Delegate administration responsibilities to select users by adding them to one of the Administrator Roles. LDAP users can also be given adminstration rights. Just ask the user to login to the console and this will create a "LDAP User" account that you can then assign to the role.
tip.adminUser.4=Consider connecting your Subversion Edge server to TeamForge for enhanced permissions management functionality. TeamForge provides a Role-Based Access Control model that allows you to delegate permissions management to project teams.

# Tips for the Repository Administration Screens
#
tip.adminRepo.1=Are you considering agile or running any agile projects already? Look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.open.collab.net/products/scrumworks/">Scrumworks Pro</a> for an easy to use agile management tool.
tip.adminRepo.2=Are you supporting a large geographically distributed team across slow WAN links? Connect Subversion Edge to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.open.collab.net/products/ctf/">TeamForge</a> and you can use their combined support for Subversion replicas and proxies. Drop a Subversion Edge proxy in the LAN of your remote team and they will get fast read access to their repositories, but still be governed by the access control model defined in TeamForge.
tip.adminRepo.3=Do you use Subversion hook scripts? You can create repository templates that contain your standard hook scripts so that all new repositories you create have these hooks installed automatically.
tip.adminRepo.4=Consider connecting your Subversion Edge server to TeamForge for enhanced permissions management functionality. TeamForge provides a Role-Based Access Control model that allows you to delegate permissions management to project teams.

# Tips for End-Users
#
tip.enduser.1=Are you considering agile or running any agile projects already? Look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.open.collab.net/products/scrumworks/">Scrumworks Pro</a> for an easy to use agile management tool.
tip.enduser.2=Download Subversion command line client or IDE Integration from the <a href="/csvn/ocn/index">Extensions page</a>.
tip.enduser.3=Most new Subversion features and fixes only require the latest client version. Download the latest clients from the <a href="/csvn/ocn/index">Extensions page</a>.
